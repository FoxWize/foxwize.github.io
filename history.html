			<p>Company History</p></td>
			<td><p class="Left_Align">As a child, Fred's family was not very wealthy. He grew up with five other siblings and had to share a lot of his belongings with them. His father worked as a lumberjack and since his family was always in such a tight financial situation, he wanted to dream bigger than lumberjacking. Fred's father aspired to be the owner of his own lumber yard and to build it into the greatest lumber yard anyone had seen. However, he never got to live out that dream because of a fatal lumberjacking accident. After his father's passing Fred decided to take up the mantel his father left behind. After becoming a lumberjack himself for several years he bought a small lumber yard at the age of 32 and his five siblings all worked with him to build it into an empire. That brings us to the present day; where Fred's Lumber is the number one lumber company in the United States. All of the lumber Fred's Lumber sells is grown in America, cut down in America, and processed right here in America. There are branches of Fred's Lumber all throughout the United States. Dispite being such an ambitious enterprise, Fred's Lumber feels more like a family than a company. Fred never lost sight of how his father would have wanted his lumber yard to look, smell, feel, and act. We can proudly say that Fred's father would have been very proud of the lumber yard his family built in his memory.</p></td>
