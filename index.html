			<td><p>The first lumber yards in the United States were established in the early-to-mid 1600s, with the earliest known one being located in Boston. The colonists themselves operated these early lumber yards because they were in need of lumber for building homes, barns, and other structures as they colonized the United States. So, the lumber industry followed the colonies as they expanded westward since the demand for lumber was only growing.</p>
			<p>Lumber yards only continued popping up more in the United States in the early 1800s, as lumber became an important resource in the flourishing American economy. This industry growth came to serve an important function in their local communities. While the lumber itself was only used to provide builders and contractors with the nessecary resources to build the new world, lumber yards also created and supported numerous jobs in the lumber industry. In addition, lumber yards were often the first point of contact for new immigrants arriving in the United States. As such, lumber yards played an important role in shaping local economies and supporting community growth.</p></td>
